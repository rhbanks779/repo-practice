<p>
	Though I live in Cincinnati now, I did not grow up there. I was born and raised in Memphis, TN. Interestingly enough, my dad went to school with Elvis Presly. 

	There are several hobbies I enjoy, but my favorite involve either playing or coaching sports. This year my son's soccer team repeated as city champions. 

	When my wife and I are not running around with 5 kids, we like to sit back and watch the show CSI. We also enjoy watching the comedian Tim Hawkins perform standup.
